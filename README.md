# Support vector machine

## Problem Definition

### Our task is to predict whether a bank currency note is authentic or not based upon four attributes of the note i.e. skewness of the  transformed image, variance of the image, entropy of the image, and curtosis of the image. This is a binary classification problem and we will use SVM algorithm to solve this problem. The rest of the section consists of standard machine learning steps.
